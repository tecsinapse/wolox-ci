# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/wolox-ci.git

Make your changes, push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Please make sure to write a [good commit message][commit] :D
